This project was created to learn the ins and outs of Godot, for personal hobby projects.

The goal was to create something simple and messy to get used to the workspace and workflow, as well as gain a greater understanding of how Godot's systems interact. There was also an effort to learn Godot best practices, though the focus was on learning, rather than perfection.

This project has served its purpose, but is available for me to add to if I wish to try learning another of Godot's systems.
